    "For this project, I am using the [2014 Amazon book review (5-core) dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) and the book metadata dataset provided by Jim McAuley and his team.

I converted the helpful column into two columns by sp, helpful_votes and total_votes, as this would be more efficient for EDA and memory. I decided to split the original file into 3 parts as I wanted to be able to do work with the dataframes efficiently when they have been read into memory at the EDA stage and I was working with an 8GM RAM. I ended up only using a portion of the data to build the user-item matrix. However, if you have more capabilites, feel free to use the entire dataset. \n",
