# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Part 5: Presentation + Non-Technical Summary

## Overview

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom won't know anything about data science!

That's why for Part 5, you'll create a short presentation that delivers the most important insights from your project to a lay audience. You've already done the analytical work; now it's time to explain your findings to the public.

Take your findings and share the most important insights from your project to a non-technical audience. Tell us the most interesting story about your data. Break down your process for a novice audience. Make sure to include compelling visuals. Time is short, so be sure to practice - and include only the most relevant components of your project.

Finally, be prepared to answer questions and explain your choices to an inquisitive audience!

**Goal:** A public presentation of your project, including an explanation of your model and findings for a non-technical audience.

## REQUIREMENTS

1. Host a short well-rehearsed presentation of your project for a non-technical audience.
   - Define technical terms and any basic data science concepts that inform your approach
   - Don't just deliver the information; tell a story about the problem and solution

2. Prepare polished visuals or a publicly-suitable slide deck to guide your presentation.
   - Include graphs and/or visualizations

3. Make sure you cover the following areas:
   - Goals
   - Success Criteria / Metrics
   - Data
   - Overall Approach
   - Basic description of model
   - Findings
   - Risks/Limitations
   - Impact, next steps, conclusions

4. Successfully answer questions about your project from your audience.

#### BONUS

5. Discuss longer term potential of your project and model.
   - Describe how you could validate your model's performance over time
   - Explain how you would deploy your model in a production environment

6. Create a publicly hosted interactive visualization that your audience can use to further access and explore your data and findings.
   - Bonus points for embedding this into your blog post tutorial!

## Deliverable Format & Submission

- Format: Interactive graphic presentation, website, or slide deck.
- Public presentation with another 5 minutes of questions.

---

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Review the information you provided in the "Executive Summary" from Part 4. This is the same information you should cover here.
- The difference is that you should **not** assume that your audience knows anything about your problem, model, or basic data science. Structure your presentation as if explaining your model to a non-data science friend.
- Practice! Test your presentation on other GA students or friends and see where they have questions.
- Include more visuals (and less text) than you think.
- Don't just read your presentation - deliver it!
