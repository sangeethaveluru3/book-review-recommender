## Overview

Begin quantitatively describing and visualizing your data. With rich datasets, EDA can go down an endless number of roads. Maintain perspective on your goals and scope your EDA accordingly.

Managing your own time is a critical skill in analysis projects. Keep notes on your approach, results, setbacks, and findings! These will form the basis of your "progress report" to us for Part 3, as you meet with your instructors to discuss how things are going and what to do next.

**Goal**: A brief report that describes your EDA and analysis so far, as well as your concrete next steps.

---

## Requirements

1. Create a "progress report" that documents:
   - Your approach to exploratory data analysis
   - Your initial results
   - Any roadblocks, setbacks, or surprises

2. Perform initial descriptive and visual analysis of your data.
   - Identify outliers
   - Summarize risks and limitations

3. Discuss your proposed next steps
   - Describe how your EDA will inform your modeling decisions
   - What are three concrete actions you need to take next?


#### BONUS

4. Visualize your EDA and approach using at least **two or more** of the data visualization methods we've covered in class.
5. Create a blog post of at least 500 words explaining your EDA so far, including your results, setbacks, and lessons learned. Link to this in your notebook.

## Deliverable Format & Submission

- Format: Jupyter Notebook

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Document **everything** as you go! This will give you valuable material to pull into your report - and will paint a more accurate picture than trying to summarize afterward :)
- Be candid! This is not a race, but a chance to get valuable feedback. Be honest about what techniques have worked, what steps have taken you down the wrong turns, and what blockers you've run into.

## Project Feedback + Evaluation

[Attached here is a complete rubric for this project.](./capstone-part-03-rubric.md)

Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

Score  | Expectations
--- | ---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
